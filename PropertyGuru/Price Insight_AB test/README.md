#Pricing insights is a feature on LDP that provide users information about price of the property in the big picture (Price in the same Project/ Ward). This feature hope to create value as a nudge, help user on confident decision making. More than that, it hope to bring transparency to user and empower them to be conscious consumer. 

Through create a nudge about price information on LDP, we hope it will lead to some objectives:

To create a nudge, helping them make confident decision in converting at LDP 

To create warning about fake/ unreasonable price (in comparison with market's price range)

To contribute to add value for listing's quality 



Evidence 
Why is this the right problem to solve?

Price information is the most important information when homebuyers are looking for a home  

Consumer can see the price of listing but they don't know is it trustable enough or not, and how itâ€™s going on the property market 

Consumer is complaining a lot about listing quality and they need to know Batdongsan.com.vn is a trusted prop-tech platform that can provide high quality of listing content (According to BDS CES Report Q1/2022, listing quality is the part that user marked lowest score overall - 3.6/5)



Value proposition: 

Investor: Investors tend to get as much information as possible, the pricing insights will help investors get an overview of the market price, which is a reliable source of reference when they intend to invest at any location. 

Home buyer: Every single home buyer will have basis knowledge about price's range of any project/ area when they use our website, make them confident in making decision and empower them to be conscious consumer.

Seller: An indirect warning to seller when their listings have a big gap with our given price's range (we have a hypothesis that if the listing has lower price in comparison with market price's range, that one can be a fake one or low qualified one), they may want to adjust or delete the listing if they don't want to be underestimated. Hence, listings of bad extremes may be restricted. 




Hypothesis:

Consumer will get insight about the price of property they are viewing. They will have more information to evaluate the price in comparison with other properties of the same project or the same ward.

Consumer afterward have motivation in dig deep into many other property listing to have more information about pricing. Thereby the engagement will be consolidated, enable them confident in making decision, drive converted rate overall. 

The more information/ insights consumer get, the lower ability they will be deceived by seller.
