Most of the projects would revolve around Listing performance/Consumer/SEO/Pricing Analysis.

For listing data source, it mainly comes from the internal system of PropertyGuru, while Consumer data is extracted and stored in Google Analytics 360 (GA360), aka GA4 at the moment.

SEO data source is collected from the multiple tools, one of which is Advance Web Rankings (AWR) - widely used for reference and benchmarking

In terms of pricing data, it comes from both internal data and external one (our engineer team built up a frequent data crawler to mine all the listing information from our main competitors - including price data as well)
